Hi!

One of my favorite movies, Interstellar featured a planet called Miller's Planet where 1 minute on Miller's Planet is 7 years on Earth.

Inspired by this concept, I have created a website where you can convert Earth time to Miller's Planet time and vice versa! Additonally you can also see how much time has elapsed on Miller's Planet since Interstellar was released.

I hope you enjoy!
